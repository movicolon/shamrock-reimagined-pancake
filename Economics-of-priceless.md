### **Saint vs. Trader**: **Things cost, but not much**

- **HOPEA Exchange**: The Trader’s in the game, wants something back—but nothing big. It’s an easy deal, something light, fair. Saint’s cool with it ‘cause it’s about balance. 
- **Happy**: Both are chill. The Saint feels good about giving, knowing it’s not a burden. The Trader’s fine too—it’s not about making a killing, just a small trade that feels right.

### **Saint vs. Anti-Saint**: **Some can’t agree on what’s priceless**

- **HOPEA Exchange**: Conflict. Saint sees worth in the non-tangibles—love, freedom, energy. Anti-Saint’s about the grind, the hustle, the cold, hard cash. HOPEA causes a clash, trying to make them see eye to eye.
- **Happy**: The Saint’s trying to stay hopeful, thinking the Anti-Saint will see the light. The Anti-Saint’s more frustrated—don’t get the point, can’t see the value.
- **Healthy**: Not so healthy. When they’re on opposite ends, it’s a struggle. No common ground. One sees the big picture, the other’s stuck on material gain.
- **Strong**: The Saint’s internally strong, but feels drained by the pushback. The Anti-Saint’s got that outer power but lacks depth, missing the soul connection.
