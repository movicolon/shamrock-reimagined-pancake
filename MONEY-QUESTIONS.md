helps them see they have the power to disarm hate, inside and out, and regain choices in life. HOPEA works by reconnecting individuals with
their true energy, pulling them out of limiting mindsets and gearing them up for the flow of abundance. By aligning them with the energy of
money—both personal and universal—HOPEA taps into the perpetual flow of exchange, much like Keynesian economics. It helps people trust the
cycle, and as they trust, they are trusted. It's a simple, recurring cycle of empowerment and growth.
